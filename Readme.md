Store embeddings in FAISS (local storage; no cloud vector database required)

Implement basic LangChain chains (no complex workflows)

Develop a simple FastAPI backend

Provide a basic HTML/JS frontend (or Streamlit for simplicity)

Features:

Upload up to 5 documents

Process and chunk documents

Generate embeddings and store them in FAISS/Chroma/Pgvector

Allow users to ask questions

Display the 3 most relevant chunks used for answering the question

Simple chat interface

Option to clear all uploaded documents

Additional Requirements:
